# Performance

A performance assignment finds where time, memory or I/O goes and proves what removes it.

- Profile before changing code (sampling profilers, hardware counters, allocation and syscall
  traces) and name the bottleneck with numbers.
- One hypothesis per experiment; about five experiments; stop at the target or the third loser in
  a row, and say what is left.
- Screen and confirm as jobs (`references/measurement.md`), with an A/A spread. Report every axis
  the project tracks (time, memory, disk, throughput), losses included, and tie a win to CPU time,
  dollars or power when the numbers allow.
- Prove attribution: separate your change from noise, drift and pre-existing effects.
- Prefer deterministic in-code mechanisms (layout, encoding, branch structure, prefetching) over
  toolchain flags, and say why the mechanism fits.
- Keep correctness checks green: a faster wrong answer is a regression. Measure the other
  platforms once, on the version that will land.
