# Research

A research assignment is rare, one at a time, when the mechanism itself is the limit or for a long-lived
bet.

- Start from the hard bound: what the hardware can do (memory bandwidth, cache sizes, branch and
  SIMD throughput, I/O) and what the problem minimally requires. Say how far the current design
  and the best known systems are from it.
- Survey fast: papers, the best permissively licensed implementations (never GPL code unless the
  project allows it), and adjacent fields; the answer is often a technique from elsewhere.
- Propose at least three distinct approaches, one of which breaks an assumption everyone makes.
  Prefer elegant mechanisms: a perfect hash, a branch-free kernel, a succinct structure.
- Prove each with a minimal prototype and a microbenchmark on the project's real data against the
  current implementation, interleaved pairs in one 10-minute exclusive job. Kill ideas quickly;
  keep the losers' numbers.
- Correctness and parity are non-negotiable; formats change only through a design review.
- Write `docs/research/<piece>.md`: the bound, the survey with sources, each idea with its result,
  and a recommendation a design or performance assignment can build.
