# Design

A design assignment takes architecture: the quest list for a consequential plan, designs of formats,
protocols, durability and concurrency, any open shape.

- Read every design, quest file and review the subject touches, and say where yours depends on or
  changes them. Cite `file:line` for every claim about existing code, after checking it; claim no
  measurement you did not make.
- Search the repository and the owner's libraries for an existing mechanism before designing a
  new one: one shape serves every caller.
- Write `docs/design/<topic>.md` (or the quest file's Decisions section when it is small):
  numbered decisions D1, ..., each with the alternatives and why they lost; contracts precise
  enough for another quest to build against; a rerunnable check for each acceptance criterion;
  open questions Q1, ... for the owner, each with options and a recommendation; the first
  buildable steps.
- Settle first what is expensive to reverse: bytes on disk, the wire format, public API, ordering
  and durability. For a protocol, write an executable model (enumerate interleavings or crash
  points, as a job) rather than a prose argument.
- Limits are load-bearing and at least as generous as the reference systems', unless a measured
  cost says otherwise.
- For a whole plan, draft the quest list: boundaries, file sets, contracts, `needs` and `after`,
  and the risk of each. The lead owns the final state.
- Stop at "ready for review" (lens `design`); build first steps only if the prompt says so.
