"""quiet: share one machine between agents' builds, tests and measurements.

Levels:
  light      Builds, tests, fuzz. A few run at once, at nice 19, on the cores a strict hold
             leaves free.
  strict     A measurement on its own cores, one at a time, beside light work. Macs can't
             split cores, so there it is exclusive.
  exclusive  A measurement with the machine to itself, for cache-sensitive A/Bs and numbers
             you publish.

`quiet LEVEL NAME MINUTES WHAT -- CMD` waits for a turn at that level, then runs CMD under a hold
every agent's quiet honors. NAME names the hold (one hold per name), MINUTES bounds it, WHAT says
what it is for. A hold ends with CMD or at its deadline; dead or expired holds are removed on sight.
`quiet help COMMAND` documents each command and its settings.
